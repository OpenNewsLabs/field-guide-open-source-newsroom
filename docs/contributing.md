# Contributing

The Field Guide to Open Source in the Newsroom is a collaborative project. It gets better every time anyone from the journalism-code community shares advice, writes up an experience, asks a question, or even just spots a typo. We'd love to add your voice to this project.

## Who should contribute

This project actively encourages contributions from people of all genders and statuses, races, ethnicities, ages, creeds, nationalities, persuasions, alignments, sizes, shapes, and journalistic affiliations. You are welcome here. By participating in this project, you are agreeing to abide by its [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct).

The guidebook also benefits from contributors of all skill levels. Telling the story of a library you released and developed into a community resource is awesome. So is asking a question as you work through your first open-source project. If you're wondering what you might be able to offer, here are a few questions to get you started:

* Could you read through the guidebook and tell us what's missing, or what could be better?
* Could you write up a case study covering a project you've worked on?
* Could you describe the cultural roadblocks you've run into in your newsroom, and how you've pushed through them?
* Could you help refine or add to the checklists at the ends of chapters?
* Could you work on translating this documentation into another language?

## Where to start

## Code of conduct

OpenNews is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free environment. This project exists in a public space, so we think it's particularly important to identify our principles in creating a supportive community.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; sustained or willful disruption of conversations or other work; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention.

* Be welcoming, friendly, patient, and kind. Ask questions. In disagreement or critique, explain why you feel the way you do, and recognize that other contributors also make decisions with good intentions and the best information available to them.

If anyone violates this code of conduct, project coordinators may take any action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the participant or banning them from contribution.
